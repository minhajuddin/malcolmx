Why the name?
-------------
You might be wondering, why I have named this tool [MalcolmX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X).
The reason is very simple, [MalcolmX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X) was one of the greatest human rights activists.
I greatly admire him, and this is a small way to make his name known, to people who
don't know him. If you liked using this tool, please take a look at his
[wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X).
